#Project: Star Dataset Analyzer
Description
The Star Dataset Analyzer is a web application designed to provide detailed insights into various types of stars based on astronomical datasets. Built using Python (Flask/Django) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, this tool allows users to select different star types and retrieve key information such as temperature, luminosity, radius, star color, and spectral class. The star data is sourced from a comprehensive CSV file, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

The application is fully responsive and offers an intuitive user interface. It features a space-themed design with dynamic animations, enhancing the user experience. The backend processes user inputs and dynamically renders star details in real-time, making it a powerful tool for educational purposes or anyone interested in astronomy.

Key Features:
Interactive selection of different star types.
Real-time display of star details, including temperature, luminosity, and more.
Responsive and aesthetically pleasing space-themed UI.
Built-in description generator for each star type.
Deployed for ease of access and use.
This project serves as an excellent demonstration of integrating datasets with interactive web technologies to create an engaging user experience.
